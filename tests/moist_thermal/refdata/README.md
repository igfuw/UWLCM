stats_lgrngn_ens_1000.txt - mean, std dev, min and max calculated from 1000 moist thermal simulations with Lagrangian microphysics, without MPI.
Differences between runs are caused by stochasticity in Lagrangian microphysics.

Eulerian microphysics (1-mom bulk) have no stochasticity, so all simulations give the same results.
stats_blk_ens_1.txt - results of blk_1m runs (same with and without MPI)
